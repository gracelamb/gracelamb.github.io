  <h1>Purpose</h1>
      <p>The purpose of The Weather Site is to give current weather conditions in 3 different ways. 
         The initial page will give the weather for the current location based on the Geocoding 
         location information from the device.  The second is weather for 3 specific locations 
         accessible through a dedicated link, and the third is weather for any location 
         determined by a search string.</p>

  <h1>Audience</h1>
      <p>The purpose of The Weather Site is to give current weather conditions in 3 different
             ways.  The initial page will give the weather for the current location based on the
              Geocoding location information from the device.  The second is weather for 3 
              specific locations accessible through a dedicated link, and the third is weather 
              for any location determined by a search string.</p>

  <h1>Audience Goals</h1>
      <p>College students move around quite a bit so one goal would be to quickly get the 
            weather conditions for their current location as they head off to class or study. 
            They are also often far from their homes so the ability to quickly get the conditions
             for a specific location is important as well.  The third goal deals with planning 
             for travels...the ability to get weather conditions for any location will help with 
             last minute packing for road trips.</p>

  <h1>Persona</h1>
          <img src="images/cool-joe.jpg" alt="Snoopy from the peanuts comics">
            <ul>
              <li>Name: Joe Cool</li>
              <li>Occupation: student</li>
              <li>Age: Eternally 18</li>
              <li>Interests: Traveling, Flying, Play acting, Eating</li>
              <li>Motivation: Joe is not into planning.  His last minute scrambling, whether it 
              is getting to class in the morning or heading out on his latest adventure, has left
              him unprepared for weather</li> 
            </ul>

  <h1>Content</h1>
      <p>All weather pages should include location name, current temperature, forecast high,
             forecast low, current weather descriptor, forecast percentage of precipitation, 
             and current wind speed and direction on small devices and hourly temps should be 
             added on larger screens. The pages of the Weather Site will be built in the 
             following order:</p>
      <h2>Pages</h2>
          <p>1.	Franklin and Greenville weather for each specific location. The weather for 
            these pages should be pulled from the weather.JSON file that will be provided.</p>
          <p>2.	Current: weather for the current location. Current location should be 
            determined by using the Geolocation API of the browser.  This information should 
            be passed to the National Weather Service (NWS) API to retrieve the current 
            conditions. </p>
          <p>3.	Search: Begins with only a search box, characters entered will cause a list 
            of suggested matches to appear.  Selected location will pull up the weather. </p>

  <h1>Styles</h1>
